# -Python-gambling-game
 a simple roulette-style game where human and computer players place bets, a winning cell is randomly chosen, and winnings are distributed accordingly until a player runs out of coins, ending the game.

 These codes represent a simple gambling game simulating a roulette-like scenario with a table, players, and betting mechanics. Here's a breakdown of their nature and functionality:

Classes:

Player: Base class for both Human and Computer players, managing attributes like name, coins, bets, etc.
Human: Inherits from Player, adds functionality for human players such as input-based betting.
Computer: Inherits from Player, handles automatic betting decisions for computer players.
Cell: Represents a betting option on the table, with attributes like name, rate, and color.
ColorBase: A class defining ANSI color codes for console output formatting.
Global Variables:

players: List to hold instances of Player subclasses.
table: List to hold instances of Cell representing betting options.
cells: List of cell names extracted from the table.
Functions:

set_cells(): Initializes the cells list by extracting names from the table.
create_players(): Creates instances of Human and Computer players.
bet_players(): Iterates through players, prompting them to place bets.
check_hit(): Simulates a roulette spin, determines winning cell, and rewards winning players.
win_player(): Calculates and distributes winnings to the player based on their bet.
show_coin(): Displays each player's current coin balance.
create_table(): Populates the table with Cell instances representing betting options.
show_table(): Displays the current state of the table including bets placed by players.
reset_table(): Resets all bets placed on the table by players.
color(): Applies color formatting to strings for console output.
green_bar(): Generates a green-colored vertical bar for formatting.
initialize(): Sets up the initial game state including table, players, and cells.
play_once(): Executes a single round of the game - bets, spins, rewards, and displays results.
is_game_end(): Checks if any player has run out of coins, signaling the end of the game.
game_end(): Handles end-of-game logic, declaring the game over and identifying the losing player.
Execution:

The play() function orchestrates the entire game by initializing, playing rounds, and handling game-over conditions.
Overall, these codes simulate a simple roulette-style game where human and computer players place bets, a winning cell is randomly chosen, and winnings are distributed accordingly until a player runs out of coins, ending the game.
